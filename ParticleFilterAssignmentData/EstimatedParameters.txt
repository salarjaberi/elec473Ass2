NOTE: All the parameters below are given as a guide and are not guaranteed.

Estimated motion model parameters:

alpha_1 = 0.0003 (rad^2/rad^2)
alpha_2 = 0.0001 (rad^2/cm^2)
alpha_3 = 0.006  (cm^2/cm^2)
alpha_4 = 1	 (cm^2/rad^2)

NOTE: These parameters assume translations in cm and rotations in radians, you will need to convert them if you operate in metres or degrees.

Estimated beam model parameters:

sigma = 20 (cm)
lambda = 0.003 (cm^-1)

Zshort = 0.15
Zhit = 0.1
Zmax = 0.01
Zrand = 0.74

Pmax = 1 if beam reading > 8000
